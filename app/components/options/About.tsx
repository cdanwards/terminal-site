        With over 8 years of software development experience, I&apos;ve worked
        on a variety of projects ranging from financial applications to mobile
        apps for Fortune 5 companies. I enjoy solving complex problems and

        When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me training for distance
        running, language learning and hanging out with my amazing family in the
        great outdoors!
